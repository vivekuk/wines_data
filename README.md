# wines_data

Introduction
The goal of this project is to clean and prepare a dataset containing information on more than 12,700 wines. The dataset suffers from various data integrity and usability issues, including missing values and potential inconsistencies.

To address these issues, I will follow a structured approach:

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure and quality.
Identify and address data integrity issues, such as missing values and outliers.
Perform data preparation steps, including data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.
Conduct a review of the prepped data to ensure that necessary adjustments have been made.
